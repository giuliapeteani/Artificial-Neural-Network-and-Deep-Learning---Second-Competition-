# Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning---Second-Competition-


Competition rules defined by prof. Boracchi G. and Matteucci M.:

"In this homework, you are required to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future. "


- **Data**: multivariate time series consisting in 7 features with length of 68528samples, all with uniform sampling rate.

- **Model Implementation**:  Convolutional LSTM with an attention layer.
